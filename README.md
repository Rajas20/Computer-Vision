# Computer-Vision

### This repository showcases implementations of three widely used feature detection algorithms in computer vision: Harris Corner Detection, SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), and SURF (Speeded-Up Robust 
### Features). These techniques are essential in tasks such as object recognition, image stitching, motion tracking, and 3D reconstruction.

##### Harris Corner Detector – Demonstrates corner detection using the Harris method, ideal for identifying strong corner points in images.
##### SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) – Implements the SIFT algorithm, which detects and describes local features that are invariant to scale and rotation.
##### SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) – Presents the SURF algorithm, an optimized version of SIFT, offering better performance in speed while maintaining robust feature extraction.
